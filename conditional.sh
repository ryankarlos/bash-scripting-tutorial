# --- int equality check ------------

# Bash can compare two or more values, either integers or
# strings, to determine if they are equal to each other, or one is greater than the other, etc.

# -lt	<
# -gt	>
# -le	<=
# -ge	>=
# -eq	==
# -ne	!=


# Now letâ€™s use these operators in some examples.
